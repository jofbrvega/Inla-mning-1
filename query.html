                  <h1>Youtubability</h1>
                  <p class="content">A key driver of youtubability is the clarity of your gameplay to a potential
                        player.</p>
                  <p class="content">Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working
                        on getting the lowest possible CPIs for your games. </p>
                  <p class="content">Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
                  <p class="content">For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is evident, for
                        example, can
                        she tell which character
                        she controls? Is the objective clear? Does it look fun to play? Has she understood the game
                        after 1 second
                        (great!) or
                        after 10 seconds (too long!).</p>
                  <p class="content">Make sure to use colours to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in
                        Helix Jump,
                        obstacles are clearly
                        contrasted (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>

            <!-- This is the second main-->
            <div class="container2">
                  <img class="phone2" src="bilder/phone2.png" alt="">
                  <p class="end">If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the
                        street, it is interesting to show
                        them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to understand their
                        expectations f rom the video
                        vs. the actual game they try.</p>
                  <p class="end2">Make it obvious with visual elements that help understand the objective and controls
                        of the game, like with the target
                        used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated
                        to drawing.</p>

                  <p class="lastpart">People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their phone’s
                        Facebook feed, everything will seem smaller
                        than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. You should also consider
                        whether your gameplay video
                        is understandable if someone watches iton a small screen. With an average watch time of 3 to 5
                        seconds, this is an
                        accelerated elevator pitch!</p>
                  <p class="lastpart">Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just
                        because it has an attractive thumbnail -
                        it’s the same idea for your game videos.</p>
